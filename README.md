# Cactro FullStack Assignment - YouTube Manager

User can login with their Google account, and get their YouTube Channels managed. They can edit title, description of any video of any channel they have in their Google Account.

Also user can add comment, reply to any comment, edit own comment. Plus there is events sending on info and error logs. These event logs are sent to Supabase DB.

## Demo
- Demo URL: https://youtube-cactro.vercel.app/
- Demo Video: https://www.loom.com/share/06a66ec69b2b45e0b65fe381416dc892?sid=8c976c1d-f6e7-4fe6-a110-41b79c7b6c73

## Tech Stack
- Next JS (App Router)
- Supabase for Event DB
- No React Query - Only Next JS server state
- Mutations using Server Action
- No Form library used - React's useFormStatus & useActionState hooks to the rescue
- Responsive UI with Tailwind
- Sonner Toast Library

## Setup
- Clone the project on local
- Add these environment variables in .env or .env.local file
    - AUTH_SECRET (add using `npx auth secret`)
    - AUTH_GOOGLE_ID (Get from Google Console)
    - AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET (Get from Google Console)
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (Get from Supabase account)
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (Get from Supabase account)
- Add this table to Supabase
```sql
create table public.events (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  message character varying null,
  type character varying null,
  constraint events_pkey primary key (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```
- Run `pnpm i`
- Go to http://localhost:3000

## Future Improvements
- Replace Auth.JS with Clerk or Manual OAuth handling
- Try to render the state returned as response of YouTube's Mutation (POST, PUT) APIs, instead of re-fetching them from GET YouTube APIs.
